# BigDataDriven_Consumer_Complaints_Analysis
******* Introduction *******
All of the analysis in this repository was done using a Hadoop cluster and Hive processing. By leveraging these powerful tools, large amounts of data related to consumer complaints in the USA were efficiently processed and analyzed. The year-on-year growth analysis and California-specific complaint statistics provide valuable insights into the overall trends and patterns in consumer complaints. Additionally, sentiment analysis and Ngram Text Processing were employed to gain more in-depth insights from the complaints narrative column, helping to identify key issues and underlying causes. Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive analysis of consumer complaints, leveraging the latest in big data technologies to deliver actionable insights.
